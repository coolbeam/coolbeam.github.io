# simple_academic_website
An easy, simple, and fast website template for academics to use as a professional page.

## Concept
Academic websites are a niche design space.  They don't need to be updated regularly, they don't need to be complicated, and most of the automatic website generation tools are serious overkill (they're also extremely slow).

This site template is designed to be fast and functional, even for users with limited download speeds and/or on mobile devices (like most academics at conferences, or most users in the developing world).  The average download per page on this website is a few kb; most automatic website generators are dozens of megabytes per page (for comparison, "War and Peace" is around 2MB).

This site was inspired by <a href="https://kevinhayeswilson.com/">Kevin H. Wilson</a> and this <a href="http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com/"> (mildly) NSFW website</a>.  


## Considerations
Links to large files (images or pdf) or to external pages are clearly indicated, to prevent surprise downloads.

If you change the background or fonts, you should check the contrast using a resource such as <a href="https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/">this</a> one.

Next feature will be a python script that reads a tab-separated variable file and builds the pages directly.
